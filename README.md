## start.gcode

Custom start code that has some advantages over the default:

* Places the nozzle just above the bed while heating so filament cannot ooze out and curl up the nozzle
* Uses full  bed temp but just 160Â°C for mesh leveling. This also helps to reduce oozing.
* Print a purge bubble and a thick purge line to fill the nozzle and clean it.
